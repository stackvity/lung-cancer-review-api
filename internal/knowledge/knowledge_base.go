// KnowledgeBase defines the interface for accessing and querying the knowledge base.
// This interface is a cornerstone of the application's architecture, providing a critical abstraction layer
// that allows for different knowledge base implementations (e.g., rule-based system, graph database, document store)
// to be used interchangeably without impacting the services that depend on it.
// This design significantly enhances modularity, testability, and future flexibility, enabling the system to adapt
// to evolving knowledge representation and storage needs.
//
// Implementations of this interface MUST meticulously consider the following critical aspects to ensure production readiness and clinical safety:
//   - Performance: Optimize for low-latency lookups, especially for frequently accessed knowledge. *CRITICAL for application responsiveness and a smooth, efficient user experience.*
//     Efficient knowledge retrieval is paramount to ensure that the system can provide timely and relevant information to users without noticeable delays. Consider employing robust caching mechanisms (e.g., in-memory caches with appropriate eviction policies, distributed caching layers), optimized data structures, and efficient query strategies to minimize latency and maximize throughput.
//   - Scalability: Design for handling a growing knowledge base and increasing query load. *IMPORTANT for long-term maintainability and system scalability as the application evolves, the knowledge base expands, and user traffic increases.*
//     The knowledge base implementation must be inherently scalable, capable of handling a larger knowledge base and a higher volume of concurrent queries without performance degradation or resource exhaustion. Explore horizontal scaling techniques, database sharding, and distributed caching solutions to ensure scalability and high availability.
//   - Data Consistency: Ensure data integrity and consistency within the knowledge base, especially if data is loaded from external sources or updated dynamically. Implement robust data validation and synchronization mechanisms to prevent data corruption, inconsistencies, and data staleness. *MANDATORY for data accuracy and reliability, which are paramount for clinical decision support and patient safety in a medical application.*
//     Maintaining data consistency is not just about technical correctness but also about ensuring the clinical validity and reliability of the information presented by the system. Implement rigorous data validation checks at data ingestion and update points, utilize transactional updates to guarantee atomicity, and consider data synchronization strategies to maintain consistency across distributed knowledge base components if applicable.
//   - Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for all data access and query operations. Define specific, granular, and well-documented error types for different failure scenarios (e.g., data not found, connection errors, parsing errors, invalid query format, knowledge base service unavailable) to allow for differentiated and context-aware error handling in the service layer. *ROBUST ERROR HANDLING IS MANDATORY for production deployments to ensure system stability, provide informative error responses to the user or calling services, and facilitate efficient debugging and error resolution.*
//   - Context cancellation: Implementations MUST respect context cancellation and timeouts to prevent resource leaks and ensure responsiveness under load. Proper context handling is *REQUIRED for production readiness* to avoid indefinite operations, prevent resource exhaustion in high-load scenarios, and ensure efficient resource management in concurrent environments.  All knowledge base operations should be context-aware and gracefully handle cancellations and timeouts.
type KnowledgeBase interface {
	// GetStagingInformation retrieves lung cancer staging information based on TNM parameters.
	// This method is a placeholder in the current implementation and is intended to be expanded in future iterations
	// to incorporate rule-based logic, access a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical guidelines (e.g., NCCN guidelines),
	// and return clinically validated and guideline-consistent staging information for lung cancer.
	//
	// In a full, production-ready implementation, the GetStagingInformation method would perform the following steps:
	//   - Query a persistent clinical knowledge base (e.g., a database of encoded NCCN guidelines, a knowledge graph, or a dedicated clinical rules engine) to determine the appropriate lung cancer stage based on the provided TNM components (T, N, M).
	//   - Apply rule-based logic and inference mechanisms to interpret the TNM values according to established staging guidelines and derive the overall stage, potentially considering edge cases, ambiguous cases, and nuances within clinical guidelines.
	//   - Return a structured object containing detailed staging information, not just a simple string.  This structured information should include:
	//     - Stage Value: The determined TNM stage (e.g., "Stage IIB") as a string or a dedicated enum for type safety and programmatic handling.
	//     - Explanation: A patient-friendly explanation of the staging, detailing the clinical meaning of the T, N, and M components and the overall stage in plain, accessible language, avoiding medical jargon.
	//     - Confidence Score (Optional): A confidence score (if applicable and reliably derivable from the knowledge base or rule engine) indicating the system's confidence in the staging assessment.  Use confidence scores cautiously and ensure they are properly interpreted and communicated to avoid misleading users.
	//     - Links to External Resources:  Include links to relevant, authoritative external resources, such as the NCCN guidelines, AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, or the American Cancer Society (ACS) staging information pages. These links should point to the specific sections of the guidelines or resources relevant to the determined stage, allowing users to access authoritative sources for further details and validation.
	//   - Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage different failure scenarios, such as:
	//     - Staging Information Not Found: Handle cases where staging information cannot be determined for the given TNM combination (e.g., invalid or incomplete TNM values, inconsistencies in the knowledge base). Return a specific, custom error type (e.g., `domain.ErrStagingInfoNotFound`) to indicate this scenario.
	//     - Knowledge Base Access Errors: Handle errors related to accessing the knowledge base, such as database connection errors, network timeouts, or service unavailability. Return specific error types (e.g., `domain.ErrKnowledgeBaseConnectionFailed`, `domain.ErrKnowledgeBaseQueryFailed`).
	//     - Rule Engine Errors (if applicable): If a rule engine is used, handle errors during rule execution or inference.
	//
	// Parameters:
	//   - ctx context.Context: Context for cancellation and timeout. Implementations MUST respect context deadlines and cancellations to ensure responsiveness and prevent resource leaks, especially in high-load scenarios.
	//   - t string:  T stage component (Tumor). Example: "T1", "T2a", "T3b". Represents the size and extent of the primary tumor.  Input validation should be performed to ensure that the T component is a valid TNM stage value.
	//   - n string:  N stage component (Node). Example: "N0", "N1", "N2". Indicates the involvement of regional lymph nodes. Input validation should be performed to ensure that the N component is a valid TNM stage value.
	//   - m string:  M stage component (Metastasis). Example: "M0", "M1a", "M1b".  Represents the presence of distant metastasis. Input validation should be performed to ensure that the M component is a valid TNM stage value.
	//
	// Returns:
	//   - string: A string containing the staging information and explanation. In the placeholder, it returns a mock explanation. In a full implementation, it should return a structured object for richer data representation.
	//   - error: An error if staging information retrieval fails. Implementations MUST return `nil` on successful retrieval and a *specific, custom error type* from `internal/domain/errors.go` on failure. Consider using `domain.ErrStagingInfoNotFound` if no staging information is found for the given TNM combination, or `domain.ErrKnowledgeBaseAccessFailed` for knowledge base access errors.
	//
	// Error Handling: *ROBUST ERROR HANDLING IS MANDATORY.*
	//   - Implementations MUST handle cases where staging information is not found for the given TNM combination. Return a specific, custom error type (e.g., `domain.ErrStagingInfoNotFound`). This allows the service layer to differentiate between "not found" errors and other types of errors, enabling appropriate error responses and logging.
	//   - Log errors appropriately using a structured logger like Zap, including the TNM parameters, error type, and any underlying errors encountered during knowledge base access or rule execution. Use structured logging to include relevant context (TNM values, error type, timestamp, request ID) for improved debugging and monitoring in production environments.

	// GetPrompt retrieves a prompt template by its ID.
	// This method is part of the PromptManager interface and is included in KnowledgeBase
	// to allow for potential future integration of prompts within the knowledge base itself,
	// creating a unified and centralized access point for application knowledge and configuration parameters.
	// In the current implementation, it provides a placeholder for prompt retrieval, simulating
	// prompt access for testing and development purposes without relying on a persistent prompt store.
	//
	// In a full implementation (beyond the current task scope), this method would:
	//   - Retrieve prompt templates from a persistent storage mechanism. This could be a database (e.g., a dedicated "prompts" table in PostgreSQL), configuration files (YAML, JSON, TOML), or a dedicated prompt management system. Database storage is generally recommended for production environments to enable dynamic updates, version control, and centralized management of prompts.
	//   - Implement caching mechanisms to improve prompt retrieval performance, especially for frequently used prompts. Consider using an in-memory cache (e.g., `ristretto`, `bigcache`, `sync.Map`) with appropriate eviction policies (e.g., LRU, time-based expiration) and cache invalidation strategies to balance performance and data freshness.
	//   - Handle different prompt versions and manage the prompt lifecycle. Implement version control for prompts to track changes, rollback to previous versions if needed, and manage the activation and deactivation of different prompt versions. Consider adding metadata to prompts, such as author, creation date, last modified date, status (draft, active, inactive, deprecated), and approval status.
	//   - Potentially support dynamic prompt generation or selection based on context, user input, or AI model version.  In more advanced scenarios, the Knowledge Base could incorporate logic to dynamically generate prompts based on the specific context of the request or select the most appropriate prompt from a set of available prompts based on user roles, application state, or AI model capabilities.
	//
	// Parameters:
	//   - ctx context.Context: Context for cancellation and timeout. Implementations MUST respect context deadlines and cancellations to ensure responsiveness and prevent resource leaks, especially under high load.
	//   - promptID string:  Unique identifier for the prompt template to retrieve.  This ID should correspond to a specific prompt stored in the knowledge base or prompt storage system.  The promptID should be used to efficiently locate and retrieve the correct prompt template from the underlying storage mechanism.
	//
	// Returns:
	//   - string: The prompt template string associated with the given promptID. In the placeholder, it returns a mock prompt template. In a full implementation, it should return the actual prompt template string, ready to be used as input to the Google AI Gemini 2.0 API calls.
	//   - error: An error if prompt retrieval fails (e.g., prompt not found, data access error). Implementations MUST return `nil` on successful retrieval and a *specific, custom error type* from `internal/domain/errors.go` on failure. Consider using `domain.ErrPromptTemplateNotFound` if the promptID does not exist in the knowledge base, or `domain.ErrKnowledgeBaseAccessFailed` for general knowledge base access errors.
	//
	// Error Handling: *ROBUST ERROR HANDLING IS MANDATORY.*
	//   - Implementations MUST handle cases where the prompt template is not found for the given promptID. Return a specific, custom error type (e.g., `domain.ErrPromptTemplateNotFound`). This allows the calling service to differentiate between "prompt not found" errors and other knowledge base errors, enabling appropriate error handling and logging.
	//   - Log errors appropriately using a structured logger like Zap, including the promptID and any underlying errors encountered during prompt retrieval. Use structured logging to include relevant context (prompt ID, error type, timestamp, request ID) for improved debugging and monitoring in production environments.

// MockKnowledgeBase is a mock implementation of the KnowledgeBase interface for testing and development.
// It provides in-memory, non-persistent implementations of the KnowledgeBase methods,
// returning predefined or placeholder data for testing purposes.
// It is explicitly NOT intended for production use in production environments due to its inherent limitations, including:
//   - Lack of Persistence: Data is not persisted across application restarts and is lost when the application terminates.
//   - Non-Scalable: In-memory data structures are not suitable for handling large knowledge bases or high query volumes, and the mock implementation does not incorporate any scalability mechanisms.
//   - No Real Clinical Knowledge: It does not encode or access real clinical guidelines or medical knowledge.  It returns hardcoded, placeholder responses that are not clinically validated or relevant.
//   - Limited Error Handling: Error handling is basic and not designed for production-level robustness.  Error conditions are simulated with simple error returns, but the mock does not implement comprehensive error management strategies.
//
// MockKnowledgeBase is primarily valuable for:
//   - Unit Testing:  Providing predictable and isolated test environments by simulating KnowledgeBase behavior without external dependencies on a real knowledge base system. Mocks allow for testing higher-level services (e.g., DiagnosisService, ReportService) in isolation, without requiring a fully functional knowledge base backend.
//   - Development:  Facilitating rapid prototyping and development of features that depend on the KnowledgeBase interface. Mocks allow frontend and backend developers to work concurrently, even before the Knowledge Base component is fully implemented. Developers can use the mock to simulate Knowledge Base interactions and build features that rely on it, deferring the integration with a real Knowledge Base to later development stages.
//   - Demonstrations and Proof-of-Concepts: Showcasing basic system functionality and interactions with the KnowledgeBase interface in a simplified and controlled manner. Mocks can be used to create demos and proof-of-concepts that highlight the system's architecture and planned features without requiring a fully functional and populated Knowledge Base.
