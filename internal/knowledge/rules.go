// rules.go

// This file is intentionally left empty in this version of the system,
// as the implementation of the rule-based system for clinical guidelines
// is deferred to future development phases (BE-048a is a placeholder task).
//
// In future iterations, this file will house the Go code for the rule-based
// system, which will be crucial for encoding clinical guidelines and best practices
// for lung cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment recommendations.
//
// The primary purpose of this rule-based system will be to:
// 1. Supplement and validate the AI-generated outputs from the Gemini 2.0 API.
// 2. Ensure that the system's preliminary assessments and suggestions are consistent with
//    established medical knowledge and clinical guidelines (e.g., NCCN guidelines for lung cancer).
// 3. Provide a transparent and explainable reasoning framework, improving the trustworthiness
//    and clinical utility of the system's outputs.
//
// Best Practices and Future Implementation Recommendations (Beyond Current Scope):
//
// 1. Rule Definitions (Recommendation 1: Future Rule Definition Strategy):
//    - Define clinical rules using Go structs to ensure type safety, readability, and maintainability.
//    - Example (Illustrative - adjust based on actual rule complexity):
//      ```go
//      type LungCancerRule struct {
//          ID          string    `json:"id"`          // Unique identifier for the rule.
//          Description string    `json:"description"`   // Human-readable description of the rule's purpose.
//          Condition   Condition `json:"condition"`     // Condition that triggers the rule (defined as a struct or interface).
//          Action      Action    `json:"action"`        // Action to be taken when the rule condition is met (defined as a struct or interface).
//          Priority    int       `json:"priority"`    // Priority of the rule for conflict resolution (integer, higher value = higher priority).
//          Version     string    `json:"version"`     // Version of the rule, for tracking changes and updates.
//          Source      string    `json:"source"`      // Source of the rule (e.g., guideline document, expert consensus).
//          // ... potentially add fields for rule status, effective date, review date, etc. ...
//      }
//
//      type Condition struct { // Example condition structure - adjust based on complexity
//          Type      string                 `json:"type"`      // Type of condition (e.g., "nodule_size_gt", "biomarker_positive").
//          Parameter string                 `json:"parameter"` // Parameter to evaluate (e.g., "nodule.Size", "biomarker.EGFR").
//          Value     interface{}            `json:"value"`     // Threshold or value to compare against.
//          Operator  string                 `json:"operator"`  // Comparison operator (e.g., "gt", "eq", "contains").
//          Units     string                 `json:"units"`     // Units of measurement, if applicable (e.g., "mm", "cm", "percentage").
//          // ... more complex condition logic can be defined using nested structs or interfaces ...
//      }
//
//      type Action struct { // Example action structure - adjust based on complexity
//          Type        string      `json:"type"`        // Type of action to take (e.g., "recommend_treatment", "flag_high_risk").
//          Target      string      `json:"target"`      // Target of the action (e.g., "treatment_options", "diagnosis.confidence").
//          Value       interface{} `json:"value"`       // Value to set or modify.
//          Justification string      `json:"justification"` // Explanation for why this action was taken, for audit trails and explainability.
//          // ... parameters specific to each action type ...
//      }

// 2. Rule Loading and Parsing (Recommendation 2: Rule Loading and Parsing):
//    - Implement logic to load and parse rules from external sources. Consider:
//      * **Database Storage:** Store rules in a dedicated database table (e.g., "rules" table in PostgreSQL). This allows for dynamic rule management, version control, and easier updates. Use `sqlc` to generate type-safe database access code for rule retrieval and management.
//      * **Configuration Files:** Load rules from structured configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML, TOML) stored in the `/internal/knowledge/data/` directory (or a dedicated config directory).  Use libraries like `encoding/json`, `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`, or `github.com/pelletier/go-toml/v2` for parsing.  This is simpler for less dynamic rule sets.
//    - Implement functions to parse rules from the chosen storage mechanism and map them to the Go struct representation (e.g., `LungCancerRule`).
//    - Include error handling for rule loading and parsing failures, with informative error messages and logging.

// 3. Rule Engine Integration (Recommendation 3: Rule Engine Integration):
//    - Evaluate and potentially integrate a Go-based rule engine library (e.g., "Ruler", "Grule", or a simpler custom-built engine).
//    - A rule engine can simplify complex rule management, conflict resolution, and rule execution logic.
//    - If a rule engine is used, define clear interfaces for interacting with the engine and passing in patient data and AI-generated findings as input.
//    - If a rule engine is not used, implement custom rule execution logic in Go code, ensuring that it is well-structured, testable, and maintainable.

// 4. Clinical Guideline Encoding (Recommendation 4: Focus on Clinical Guidelines):
//    - Focus on encoding specific, relevant clinical guidelines for lung cancer (e.g., NCCN guidelines for lung cancer) into the rule-based system.
//    - Work closely with medical advisors to ensure that the encoded rules accurately reflect current medical knowledge, best practices, and clinical consensus.
//    - Prioritize encoding rules related to TNM staging, treatment recommendations, and risk stratification, as these are key areas where a rule-based system can provide valuable support and validation for the AI's outputs.
//    - Ensure that the rules are regularly reviewed and updated by medical advisors to reflect changes in clinical guidelines and medical knowledge.

// 5. Testing Strategy for Rules (Recommendation 5: Testing Strategy for Rules):
//    - Develop a comprehensive unit testing strategy for the rule-based system. This should include:
//      * Unit tests for individual rules: Verify that each rule's condition and action logic is implemented correctly and produces the expected output for various inputs. Use table-driven tests to cover different scenarios and edge cases.
//      * Integration tests for rule combinations: Test the interaction and conflict resolution between multiple rules. Ensure that rule priorities are correctly applied and that the system behaves as expected when multiple rules are triggered.
//      * Integration tests with Knowledge Base and Gemini API outputs: Test the integration of the rule-based system with the Knowledge Base and the AI-generated findings from Gemini 2.0. Use mocks and stubs to simulate external dependencies and isolate the rule logic for testing.
//      * End-to-end tests:  Develop higher-level integration or end-to-end tests that verify the entire rule-based reasoning flow, from data input to final output. These tests should simulate realistic patient scenarios and data inputs.
//      * Test data: Create a comprehensive test data set that covers a wide range of clinical scenarios, edge cases, and potential rule interactions. Use realistic and, if possible, anonymized clinical data for testing.

// For the current task, this file serves as a placeholder and documentation for future rule-based system implementation.
// No functional Go code for rule execution is included in this file at this stage.
